                <p>Achieving high process energy efficiency and ensuring high product quality are the hallmarks of
                    cost-effective cement production. The use of alternative fuels is becoming increasingly important.
                    This makes it even more necessary to monitor the relevant processes using continuous gas analysis
                    measurement technology. Compliance with the applicable local emission limit values must also be
                    ensured. SICK analyzer measuring systems and the related technologies are best suited to handle the
                    demanding requirements of cement plant operations. SICK's broad product portfolio makes it possible
                    to find the optimal solutions for measuring the required operational parameters, even at high gas
                    temperatures and dust concentrations.</p>

                <p> Solutions with the latest ultrasonic technology
                    Gas pipelines are used all over the world for transporting natural gas from natural gas fields or
                    gas
                    storage to end consumers. The gas flow in the pipeline is measured for billing purposes which
                    requires
                    volume flowmeters with top accuracy. At present, the most accurate, efficient and technically best
                    solution is measurement with ultrasonic gas flowmeters. Technology leader SICK with its FLOWSIC
                    meters
                    enjoys worldwide recognition in this field</p>
