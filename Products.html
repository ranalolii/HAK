                    <p>The Analyzer shelter gives a safe and robust enclosure for the gas analyzer systems and it’s
                        equipped
                        with power distribution, communication panels and equipped with Air conditioning, gas cylinder

                        comes
                        with
                        emergency shutdown of the system depending up on the internal temperature.<br><br>

                        The Analyzer shelters provide a controlled environment for protection of gas analyzer systems
                        and as
                        well as ease of use and maintenance. It’s useful for installations of gas analyzer systems in

                                monitoring involves the measurement of “representative” air in urban, industrial and
                                rural
                                areas. These measurements are used to determine the human exposure to pollutants and can

                                combined with trace/background monitoring as well as stack monitoring to assess an

                    <p>
                    <h3> Ultrasonic Gas Meter for Custody Transfer and Process Gas Measurement</h3>
                    Natural gas flows through pipelines or into storage tanks, often changing hands along its route.
                    This always means that the gas flow rate must be measured with the highest accuracy and precision.
                    Tiny
                    measuring errors can have a significant economic impact due to the large amounts of natural gas
                    involved. A stable gas meter should remain unaffected by adverse measuring conditions, such as
                    background noise in the pipeline. This challenge is effectively handled by ultrasonic gas
                    meters.<br><br>

                    These meters can be equipped with multiple non-reflective, chordal measuring paths, making them
                    ideal for applications ranging from high-accuracy custody transfer to less precise requirements like
                    flare
                    and underground storage.<br><br>

                    <h3> Custody Transfer Measurement in Natural Gas Distribution</h3>
                    Local authorities purchase natural gas and sell it to users such as power stations, primary
                    industries,and other industrial consumers. Given the considerable volumes of gas involved, precise
                    and, above
                    all,long-term reliable input and output measurements are crucial. Conventional mechanical gas meters
                    are
                    difficult to monitor and require costly maintenance, making them less practical.<br><br>

                    Ultrasonic gas meters, designed specifically for the natural gas distribution market, address these
                    challenges. They offer an efficient, low-maintenance, and highly accurate alternative to traditional
                    mechanical meters.

                    CONDITIONS<br><br>

                    The measurement of flare gas in the chemical and petrochemical industry is widely considered to be
                    the leading discipline in gas flow measurement. In no other area do the application conditions and
                    resulting
                    requirements for measuring technology pose such a challenge.<br>
                    The primary area of application involves calculating greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of
                    flare gas measured in accordance with regulatory requirements. FLOWSIC100 Flare has been developed
                    for precisely this purpose. State-of-the-art sensor technology and high-quality components ensure
                    highly accurate and reliable measurement with the utmost failure safety protection – even under
                    extreme
                    conditions on oil rigs and at remote oil fields. Even very low flow rates can be accurately
                    detected,the measuring device is also suitable for continuous process monitoring and optimization as
                    well as for detecting
                    the smallest leaks in the flare gas network.</p>

                                Hopper impact vibrators / bin activators errect bunker walls by periodic oscillations in
                                shock and so the friction between the bulk and bunker wall (caking). They are just for
                                knocking out of forms, for shaking of chutes and downpipes, for better emptying of
                                containers and
                                bulk materials from adhering to solve, for example in filters. The most common
                                activators are
                                unbalanced motors and magnetic vibrators. For special and heavy demands, there are
                                impact vibrators

                                Trough conveyors are suitable for conveying and metering of pourable bulk material up to
                                almost any particle size. By ensuring robust and open, trough-shaped structure are
                                particularly
                                suitable conveyors in extreme environmental conditions, because of the easy cleaning
                                ability, but also happy in the chemical and food industry<br><br>

                    <h2> Marine Sensors and Measuring Instruments</h2>
                    <p> For over 100 years we have been making precise mechanical instruments, which even in their
                        original
                        form can
                        still handle a large portion of modern measurement technology tasks. All our products are
                        manufactured
                        solely at our company headquarters in Kaufungen – that‘s quality „Made in Germany“. Our range of
                        mechanical
                        instruments includes industrial glass thermometers, precision dial thermometers, matching
                        protective
                        tubes
                        for thermometers, high-quality pressure gauges, force sensors and load cells. Our strengths also
                        include
                        short delivery times, individual customer consultation, and tailored instrumentation solutions.
